# DP-Flex: Printable Versatile Hand with Compliant Distant Phalanges

# Introduction
Robots operating in human environments must manipulate common tools, which require functional grasping to interact with components like triggers and buttons. Since most objects are designed for human use, robotic grippers must adopt anthropomorphic designs featuring five-fingered topology with opposable thumbs and human-matched kinematics/phalanx dimensions.
Achieving this functionality involves designing a gripper that closely mimics the human hand. Guided by trade-off challenge between being compact, powerful, compliant, simple to manufacture, and easy to deploy for learned control policies, we designed DP-Flex, a three-fingered hand actuated by seven off-the-shelf motors, featuring 3D-printed linkage parts and additional molded silicone patches to enhance grip and softness at contact points.

# Design choices and features
DP-Flex was designed to get a niche between availability, fast prototyping and dexterity. Three-fingered design makes the hand able to grasp objects using opposable thumb and objects adapting flexible distant phalanges.
The workspace of the fingers was optimized to ensure opposability of the thumb enhancing possibility for gestures and reproduce most of the Cutkovscky's taxonomy.
